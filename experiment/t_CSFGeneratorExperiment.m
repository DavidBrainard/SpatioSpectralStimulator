%% Initialization
clear; close all;

%% Parameters
%
% Set up color direction
conditionName = 'LminusMSmooth';
colorDirectionParams = SetupColorDirection(conditionName);

% Set spatial parameters


%% Instantiate a sceneGenerationEngine
%
% The first step is to define the spatial and temporal parameters of a
% scene.  We do this by instantiating a sceneEngine object, passing it a
% function that is responsible for defining the scene as well as a struct
% of parameters that that function accepts.
%
% The name of passed function should by convention begin with the prefix
% 'sce'.
%
% Also by convention, the passed function called with no arguments returns
% a struct of default parameters, making it easy to see what can be
% controlled.
%
% Once the sceneEngine has been instantiated, its compute method may be
% called with a standard set of arguments and return a standard set of
% values, so that the details of what it does are transparent to other
% steps in the pipeline.  See examples below for this usage.  The compute
% method needs to know how to vary the parameter that is being varied to
% find threshold. The canonical usage is to vary contrast, but nothing in
% the code actually cares about the semantics.
%
% See t_sceneGeneration and t_modulatedGratingSceneGeneration for tutorials
% that focus on how to use the sceneEngine.  See the functions
% sceUniformFieldTemporalModulation and sceGrating for example
% implementations of compute functions to use with the sceneEngine object.
%
% Choices of passed functions that can be used in this tutorial are:
%   'sceUniformFieldModulation'
whichSceneEngine = 'sceUniformFieldModulation';
switch (whichSceneEngine)
    case 'sceUniformFieldModulation'
        % Spatially uniform field temporal modulation
        %
        % Note use of call without arguments to get default parameters
        % struct, and adjustment of size to make it small.  This speeds
        % things up for this demo.
        sceneParams = sceUniformFieldTemporalModulation;
        sceneParams.sizePixels = 5;
        
        % Instantiate the sceneEngine object
        theSceneEngine = sceneEngine(@sceUniformFieldTemporalModulation,sceneParams);
        
    otherwise
        error('Unknown scene engine specified');
end

%% Instantiate a neuralResponseEngine.
%
% The neural response engine is our model of visual processing, code that
% takes a scene sequence as input and produces the neural representation as
% output.  The scene sequence is produced by the sceneEngine object, and
% the neural responses are provided to a classifier object for making
% perceptual decisions.
%
% The structure of the neural response engine is conceptually similar to
% that of the scene engine.  The user provides a function that does the
% computations, and instantiates the neural response engine with this
% function.  The function takes a struct of parameters, which may be
% included with the instantiation.  By convention, the function will return
% a struct of its default arguments if called with no inputs.
%
% The way we have set up the neuralResponseEngine, the passed function
% takes two important key/value pairs.
%    'noiseFlags'                   - Cell array of strings containing labels
%                                     that encode the type of noise to be included
%                                     Valid values are: 
%                                        - 'none' (noise-free responses)
%                                        - 'random' (noisy response instances)
%                                     Default is {'random'}.  Only one
%                                     instance is returned when set to
%                                     'none', independent of how many are
%                                     asked for.
%   'rngSeed'                       - Integer.  Set rng seed. Empty (default) means don't touch the
%                                     seed.
%
% You can pass more than one noise flag in the cell array of strings.  The
% response engine computes for each of these, and returns the responses for
% each noise flag in a Matlab container. Containers are very convenient but
% take a little getting used to.  We provide some usage comments where the
% neural response engine is called a bit further down.  We also explain
% there the format of the returned responses.
%
% The use of two example neural response engines is illustrated below.
%
% Choices are:
%   'nrePhotopigmentExcitationsWithNoEyeMovements'
%   'nreScenePhotonNoise'
whichNeuralEngine = 'nrePhotopigmentExcitationsWithNoEyeMovements';

%% Instantiate a responseClassifierEngine
%
% responseClassifierEngines are responsible for simulating observer
% performance on a psychophysical task, given noisy samples of the output of the
% neuralResponseEngine.  As with our other objects, they are instantiated
% with a function that does this work.  This function must be able to train
% the classifier given samples of the neural responses, and then predict
% on a simulated trial-by-trial basis whether that trial was correct or
% incorrect.  
%
% For the most part, we simulate two-alternative forced-choice trials, but
% we think the framework will work for at least some other psychophysical
% tasks.
%
% The same general conventions apply to responseClassifierEngines as to our
% other objects. Usage is illustrated below.
%
% A larger nTest is usually more effective, but depending on the performance
% bottleneck of your observer, you might consider a smaller nTest.  If it
% is fast to compute the classifier for a given contrast and slow to make
% predictions for a trial, then small nTest will be better.  If
% it's slow to build a classifier for a given contrast and fast to make
% predictions, then large nTest will be better.
%
% Choices are:
%   'rcePoissonTAFC'
%   'rceTemplateTAFC'
%   'rcePcaSVMTAFC'
whichObserver = 'rcePoissonTAFC';

        % Below we use a wrapper routine to train the classifier and to
        % predict trial-by-trial responses.  Because that routine is
        % general, we define some parameters for it here.
        %
        % We'll illustrate a signal known exactly classifier, using the trainFlag value
        % of 'none' to indicate that the classifier should be trained with a noise free
        % version of the stimuli.  We'll test with noisy values, however.
        %
        % Similarly, since this is a template type of classifer, we can just pass one
        % noise free examplar of the NULL and TEST stimuli.  We choose here to predict
        % performance on 120 stimuli for each contrast tested.  This is because classification

%% Construct a QUEST threshold estimator estimate threshold on log contrast
%
% We have found that computing out psychometric functions takes a long time
% if you use the method of constant stimuli.  Thus we use an adaptive
% psychophysical procedure, QUEST+, to make the computations efficient.
% You can learn more about QUEST+ at the gitHub site that has our QUEST+
% Matlab implementation: https://github.com/BrainardLab/mQUESTPlus.
%
% A features of QUEST+ is that you need to specify a discrete list of
% contrast values that will be tested, which in the wrapper here is also
% taken as the set of possible thresholds as QUEST+ chooses stimulus values.
% We also discretize the possible slopes of the underlying Weibull
% psychometric function.  As noted above, appropriate choices for these
% depend on the neural engine (and possibly the quality of the response
% classifier) and need to be set on the basis of experience.  There is also
% a little art to choosing the spacing of the discrete values.  Too many
% and QUEST+ will run slowly; too few and it may not be able to put stimuli
% in the right places.
estDomain  = -logThreshLimitLow : logThreshLimitDelta : -logThreshLimitHigh;
slopeRange = slopeRangeLow: slopeDelta : slopeRangeHigh;

% There are two recommended ways to setup the QUEST+ threshold engine,
% which vary in terms of how clever they try to be about how many trials to
% run before stopping.
%
% The fixed number option runs a fixed number of trials.  This is fine if
% you have a good idea of how many trials you need to obtain the accuracy
% you want.
%
% In adaptive mode, we set up multiple QUEST+ instances and run them
% interleaved. We stop when the standard error of the threshold estimates
% across them becomes small enough.  See below for more.
%
% Note the explicit setting of the PF for the questThresholdEnging.  Using
% @qpPFWeibullLog causes it all to happen in log10 units, rather than the
% default dB units.
%
% Choices:
%   'fixedNumber'    - run a fixed number of trials
%   'adaptiveMode'   - run until estimate reaches specified precision.
% See below for more.
questMode = 'adaptiveMode';
switch questMode
    case 'fixedNumber'
        % Run fixed number of trials.  This is done by setting 'minTrial' and
        % maxTrial values to be the same and running a single Quest+
        % object.
        estimator = questThresholdEngine('minTrial', 1e3, 'maxTrial', 1e3, ...

    case 'adaptiveMode'
        % Run 'numEstimator > 1' interleaved QUEST+ objects. In this case,
        % the threshold engine calculates the running standard error (SE)
        % among those objects. Essentially, this is an internal estimate of
        % the precision of the current threshold estimate.  Given this, the
        % stopping criterion is triggered when either of the following is
        % true
        %   1) total number of trials >= 'minTrial' AND the 'stopCrition'
        %   is true.
        %   2) when total number of trials >= 'maxTrial'.
        % The total number of trials includes all the trials across the
        % multiple QUEST+ objects.
        %
        % The 'stopCriterion' itself can be defined in two ways.  
        %   1) A single number. In this case, the criterion will be
        %      true when the SE is less than the specified number.
        %   2) A function handle that takes the current estimate of threshold
        %      and SE estimates as input arguments, and returns a boolean variable.
        %      For example: we can use a relative criterion w.r.t. the magnitude of threshold  
        %
        % Comment in either of the lines below to chose which you do. As
        % with the contrast range, there is some art to choosing the
        % specific values for the stop criterion, as well as the min and
        % max number of trials.  For example, the relative stopping
        % criterion in the function handle below can terminate too early if
        % initial threshold values are large.  This can be avoided by
        % appropriate choice of minimum number of trials.
